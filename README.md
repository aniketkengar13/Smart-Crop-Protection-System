### Smart Crop Protection System

The **Smart Crop Protection System** is an automated solution designed to protect agricultural fields from potential threats such as intruders, animals, or environmental factors using sensors and electronic components. The system leverages a **PIC microcontroller** as the core processor, interfacing with various sensors, a GSM module, and alert mechanisms to monitor and safeguard crops effectively.

#### Key Components:
1. **PIC Microcontroller**: The brain of the system that processes data from sensors and controls output devices.
2. **GSM Module**: Sends alert messages (SMS) to the farmer when an intrusion or abnormal condition is detected.
3. **Sensors**:
   - **PIR Sensor (Passive Infrared)**: Detects motion in the field.
   - **Sound Sensor**: Picks up noise that could indicate trespassing or animal activity.
   - **IR Sensor**: Detects physical obstacles or intrusions.
   - **Laser Diode**: Acts as an optical tripwire for detecting intrusions.
4. **Buzzer**: Provides an audible alarm when the system detects any threat.
5. **LCD Display**: Shows real-time status messages and alerts, helping to monitor the system locally.

#### How It Works:
- The system continuously monitors the field using sensors. If motion (PIR), sound, or an obstacle (IR sensor) is detected, the system triggers an alarm through the buzzer.
- The **GSM module** sends an alert message to the farmer's mobile phone with a specific alert (e.g., "Motion detected", "Intrusion detected").
- The **LCD display** shows the type of event detected for local monitoring.
- The **laser diode** can be used as a tripwire sensor that activates upon breaking the beam, signaling an intrusion.
